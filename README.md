This is a repository where you can find all the information of manuscript **Spatial genetic structure of two conifers in a highly human-modified landscape of central Mexico**, co-authored by BÃ¡rbara Cruz-Salazar, Alejandro Flores-Manzanero, Yendi Navarro-Nota and Yessica Rico.

There are two folders: 1. `Data`, with the main database; and 2.`Bin`, where are the scripts used to filter the data.

In folder `Data` the following files:

The `Abies_religiosa.txt` and `Pinus_montezumae.txt` files include a list of the analyzed individuals of each conifer, by population, slope and cohort, as well as the geographic position in UTM (X, Y) of each sample.

The `OutliersAbies_religiosa.txt` and `OutliersPinus_montezumae.txt` files contain a list of candidate loci for selection (outliers), obtained from the analysis performed with PCAdapt.

The rasters (`cem.tif`, `LandUse.tif`, `Aspect_sine.tiff` and `Aspect_cosene.tiff`) are the resistance surfaces used in ResistanceGA.
